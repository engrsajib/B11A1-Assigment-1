                    a "new Bangladesh," emphasizing national unity and comprehensive reforms. On January 15, 2025,

                    of new Bangladesh" based on national unity. This charter aims to encapsulate the spirit of the
                    mass uprising and serve as a national commitment, with all political parties expected to endorse
                    it.
